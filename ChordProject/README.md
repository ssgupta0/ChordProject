Chord Creator

This project will work in the terminal. Usually chord creation would need some basic music theory 
knowledge of what are the "right" notes to place in a chord, but the Chord Creator makes creating 
scientifically proven "good" notes very simple!

This project uses C++, with the inputs and outputs all being on the terminal command line.
